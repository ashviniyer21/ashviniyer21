Hi,
     My name is Ashvin Iyer, and I'm a Purdue CS student interested in Autonomous Robots!

I mostly use **C/C++** and **Python**,but I am also familiar with Java, MATLAB, and more.

Experience:
- Intern at [Kodiak Robotics](https://kodiak.ai): Working on the simulation / motion planning
- Student Researcher at [CoRAL Lab](https://corallab.net): Published [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16318.pdf) to IROS 2023
- Software Lead at [Purdue Lunabotics](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~lunabot): worked on perception and navigation algorithms for a lunar rover
