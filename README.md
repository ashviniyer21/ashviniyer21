Hi,
     My name is Ashvin Iyer, and I'm a Purdue CS student, software lead of [Purdue Lunabotics](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~lunabot/) and alumni of [Mitty Robotics](https://www.amhsrobotics.com/). 

I mostly use **C/C++** **Python**, and **Java**, but I am also familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, MATLAB, and more.

I am currently trying to learn more about SLAM and autonomous navigation in general.
